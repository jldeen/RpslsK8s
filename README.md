# <a name="deployment-scenarios"></a>Deploy to Azure

You can either go through all steps and customizing its configuration or run one single command.

## <a name="deploy-unified"></a>Deploy RPSLS using one script

Execute the script located in Deploy folder with the following parameters:
```
.\Deploy-Unified.ps1 -resourceGroup <resource-group-name> -location <location> -clientId <service-principal-id> -password <service-principal-password> -subscription <subscription-id>
```

- `resourceGroup`: The name of your resource group where all infrastructure will be created `Required`
- `location`: Select where you want to create your resource group, for example: `eastus` `Required`
- `clientId`: Id of the service principal used to create the AKS `Optional`
- `password`: Password of the service principal `Optional`
- `subscription`: Id of your subscription where you are going to deploy your resource group `Required`

If service principal credentials are not passed a new one will be created.

## <a name="deploy-resources"></a>Deploy RPSLS step by step

To run RPSLS you need to create the Azure infrastructure. There are two ways to do it. Using Azure portal or using a Powershell script.

### <a name="create-infrastructure-portal"></a>Step 1 - Option 1: Creating infrastructure using Azure Portal

An ARM template is provided so you can create the whole infrastructure required for RPSLS

<a href="https://portal.azure.com/?WT.mc_id=devops-0000-jessde#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FMicrosoft%2FRockPaperScissorsLizardSpock%2Fmaster%2FDeploy%2Farm%2Fdeployment.json"><img src="Documents/Images/deploy-to-azure.png" alt="Deploy to Azure"/></a>

- `servicePrincipalId`: Id of the service principal used to create the AKS `Required`
- `servicePrincipalSecret`: Password of the service principal `Required`
- `aksVersion`: AKS version to use. `Required`

The deployment could take more than 10 minutes, and once finished all needed resources will be created.

### <a name="create-infrastructure-cli"></a>Step 1 - Option 2: Create the resources using the CLI

You can use the CLI to deploy the ARM script. Open a Powershell window from the `/Deploy` folder and run the `Deploy-Arm-Azure.ps1` with following parameters:

- `-resourceGroup`: Name of the resource group `Required`
- `-location`: Location of the resource group `Required if resourceGroup does not exist`
- `-clientId`: Id of the service principal used to create the AKS `Optional`
- `-password`: Password of the service principal `Optional`

If service principal credentials are not passed a new one will be created.

Once script finishes, everything is installed. If a service principal has been created, the script will output the service principal details - _please, take note of the appId and password properties for use them in the AKS deployment_

### <a name="deploy-aks"></a>Step 2: Deploy RPSLS on AKS

Pre-requisites for this deployment are to have:

- The AKS and all related resources deployed in Azure
- A terminal with Powershell environment
- [Azure CLI 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest&WT.mc_id=devops-0000-jessde) installed.
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) installed with the last version (v1.16.0 at this moment).
- Docker installed

#### Service Principal

A Service Principal is needed for creating the AKS. If you use the [CLI for create the resources](#create-infrastructure-cli). You need the client id and password of a Service Principal to install RPSLS.

In case you use [Azure Portal for the resources' creation](#create-infrastructure-portal), you can also reuse a SP or create manually a new one for passing the credentials to the template.

#### Connecting kubectl to AKS

From the terminal type:

- `az login` and follow instructions to log into your Azure.
- If you have more than one subscription type `az account list -o table` to list all your Azure subscriptions. Then type `az account set --subscription <subscription-id>` to select your subscription
- `az aks get-credentials -n <your-aks-name> -g <resource-group-name>` to download the configuration files that `kubectl` needs to connect to your AKS.

At this point if you type `kubectl config current-context` the name of your AKS cluster should be displayed. That means that `kubectl` is ready to use your AKS

#### Installing Tiller on AKS

Helm is a tool to deploy resources in a Kubernetes cluster in a clean and simple manner. It is composed of two tools, one client-side (the Helm client) that needs to be installed on your machine, and a server component called _Tiller_ that has to be installed on the Kubernetes cluster.

To install Helm, refer to its [installation page](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm). Once Helm is installed, _Tiller_ must be deployed on the cluster. For deploying _Tiller_ run the `./Add-Tiller.ps1` (from Powershell).

Once installed, helm commands like `helm ls` should work without any error.

#### Configuring services

Before deploying services using Helm, you need to setup the configuration. We refer to the configuration file with the name of _gvalues_ file. This file **contains all secrets** so beware to not commit in your repo accidentally.

An example of this file is in `helm/gvalues.yaml`. The deployment scripts use this file by default, **but do not rely on editing this file**. Instead create a copy of it a folder outside the repository and use the `-valuesFile` parameter of the deployment script.

> **Note:** The folder `/Deploy/helm/__values/` is added to `.gitignore`, so you can keep all your configuration files in it, to avoid accidental pushes.

Please refer to the comments of the file for its usage.

##### Auto generating the configuration file

Generating a valid _gvalues_ file can be a bit harder, so there is a Powershell script that can do all work by you. This script assumes that all resources are deployed in the same resource group, and this resource group contains only the RPSLS resources. Also assumes the Azure resources have been created using the **tools provided in this repo**.

> **Note** The Generate-Config.ps1 uses the _application-insights_ CLI extension to find the application insights id. Install it with `az extension add --name application-insights`

To auto-generate your _gvalues_ file just go to `/Deploy/powershell` folder and from a Powershell window, type the following:

```
.\Generate-Config.ps1 -resourceGroup <your-resource-group> -outputFile ..\helm\__values\<name-of-your-file>
```

The `Generate-Config.ps1` script accepts so many parameters. [Here](./Deploy/powershell/readme.md#Generate-Config) you can find a list of them all.

The script checks that all needed resources exists in the resource group. If some resource is missing or there is an unexpected resource, the script exits.

#### Build & deploy images to ACR

You can **manually use docker-compose** to build and push the images to the ACR. If using compose you can set following environment variables:

- `TAG`: Will contain the generated docker images tag
- `REGISTRY`: Registry to use. This variable should be set to the login server of the ACR

Once set, you can use `docker-compose build` and `docker-compose push` to build and push the images.

Additionally there is a Powershell script in the `Deploy` folder, named `Build-Push.ps1`. You can use this script for building and pushing ALL images to ACR. Parameters of this script are:

- `resourceGroup`: Resource group where ACR is. **Required**.
- `acrName`: ACR name (not login server). **Required**.
- `dockerTag`: Tag to use for generated images (defaults to `latest`)
- `dockerBuild`: If `$true` (default value) docker images will be built using `docker-compose build`.
- `dockerPush`: If `$true` (default value) docker images will be push to ACR using `docker-compose push`.

This script uses `az` CLI to get ACR information, and then uses `docker-compose` to build and push the images to ACR.

To build and push images tagged with v1 to a ACR named my-acr in resource group named my-rg, execute the following command inside `/Deploy/powershell`

```
.\Build-Push.ps1 -resourceGroup my-rg -dockerTag v1 -acrName my-acr
```

To just push the images (without building them before):

```
.\Build-Push.ps1 -resourceGroup my-rg -dockerTag v1 -acrName my-acr -dockerBuild $false
```

#### Deploying services

You need to use Powershell and run `./Deploy-Images-Aks.ps1`. A typical call is:

```ps
.\Deploy-Image-Aks.ps1 -resourceGroup $resourceGroup -aksName $myAks -acrName $myAcr -valuesFile $myValuesFilePath
```

**Note**: Read the [documentation of this script](./Deploy/powershell/readme.md) for a list of all parameters.

This script will install all services using Helm and your custom configuration from the configuration file set by `-valuesFile` parameter.

The parameter `charts` allow for a selective installation of charts. Is a list of comma-separated values that mandates the services to deploy in the AKS. Values are:

- `cs` C# Player.
- `nj` NodeJS Player.
- `py` Python Player.
- `php` PHP Player.
- `jv` Java Player.
- `web` Website
- `gm` Game Manager
